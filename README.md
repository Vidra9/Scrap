# OVERVIEW

[Scrap](https://thevidra.itch.io/scrap) is a game built for the 2024 Game Jam for the 2 days submition mark (with some fixes later for a local presentation)

The game is a top down rougelike survival shooter, in which you need to destroy incoming waves of enemies and collect scraps from them in order to empower yourself.
Collecting scrap is a careful balance between power and size/manuverability.
The more scrap you have attached to you the slower you move and the bigger target you become.

You get *3 lives*, these only get taken away when you suffer a direct hit.

There's three types of debree that could possibly drop: Yellow (Triangle), Red (Rectangle) and Blue (Rhombus).
Yellow and Blue also have a "weapon" varient in which case if you pick them up, you also gain an additional gun that behaves as it would on the enemy.

# CONTROLS
- WASD / Arrow keys for movement
- Mouse to aim and LMB to shoot
